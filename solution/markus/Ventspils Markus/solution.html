      <p>If you plan to change your car or maybe buy your first personal car, maybe an environmentally friendly car will be the most suitable for you, because it has many advantages - from cheaper transportation to tax discounts. Therefore, familiarize yourself with the most important things you need to know if you want to buy a car with state support. The total state support in this program is <strong>10 million euros</strong>, of which another <strong>6 million euros</strong> are available, for which you can apply until <strong>December 31, 2024</strong> or until the available funding ends, the balance of which you can follow online on the website of the <a href="https://ekii.lv/index.php?page=auto-iegade">Environmental Investment Fund</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Find out which car purchase is supported by the state</h2>
      <p>You can receive <strong>4,500 euros</strong> from the state for the purchase of your new electric car, and <strong>2,250 euros</strong> for the purchase of a used car. In order for the chosen car to meet the conditions, take into account the criteria of the program, because you will be able to buy with state support only those cars that will be published in the list of supported cars on the website of the <a href="https://ekii.lv/index.php?page=auto-iegade">Environmental Investment Fund</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="card-title">Support is available if the car meets the following criteria:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span><b>A new electric car</b> - one whose only driving force is the electricity stored in it, and the <i>of greenhouse gases (GHG)</i> is zero. It has been used for less than <strong>six months</strong> or driven less than <strong>6,000 kilometers</strong>. The mileage between full charges must be at least <strong>150 kilometers</strong> and with a maximum driving speed of at least <strong>90 km/h</strong>. The selling price of the car in the basic configuration must not exceed <strong>60,000 euros (without VAT)</strong>;</span></li>
    <br>
    <li><span><b>Used electric car</b> - corresponds to the parameters of a new electric car, with the difference that it has not been registered in Latvia for more than <strong>six months</strong> and the selling price in the basic configuration isn't lower than <strong>5,500 euros</strong> and does not exceed <strong>60,000 euros (without VAT)</strong>;</span></li>
    <br>
    <li><span><b>A new externally chargeable (or PLUG-IN) hybrid car</b> - differs from the electric car criteria only in the total permissible amount of GHG emissions - up to <strong>50 g CO2/km</strong> according to the combined cycle of the Harmonized Light Vehicle Testing Procedure (WLTP) and mileage only with the electric energy stored in the vehicle between full charges sometimes at least <strong>50 kilometers</strong>. Here, too, the selling price in the basic configuration must not exceed <strong>60,000 euros (without VAT)</strong>.</span></li>

      <h4>For example, buying a new Nissan Leaf, the price of which is EUR 30,749, using bank financing for five years with a 15% down payment, which also includes a state aid of EUR 4,500, and an interest rate of 0% for the first two years + 6 months. Euribor rate (Euribor value on 29.06.2023 - 3.892%) and commission: 1.5% of the purchase value of the car, in financial leasing the monthly payment for the first two years would be 480 and later 491 euros with the total amount to be repaid being 29,613.66 euros . On the other hand, in operational leasing, the monthly payment for the first two years would be 318 and later 341 euros, the total amount to be repaid is 29,169.25 euros, and the remaining value of the car is 35%.</h4>

    <p>J훮nis Me탑malis was also convinced of the advantages of this car, who after a one-day test drive with his neighbor's BMW i3 and experiencing the advantages of an electric car "on his own skin", decided that after much thought it was the right time to buy an electric car for himself.</p>
    <div id="citata">
      <h4>"The primary reason why I chose to buy an electric car was the desire to become more environmentally friendly with my daily habits. The idea of buying an electric car has been floating around for a long time, but unfortunately, the range available on the market was not so pleasing both in terms of price and technical performance. Over time, the supply-price ratio has balanced out, and electric car technology has developed rapidly. In addition, slightly used cars on the second-hand market are currently at a very attractive price," says J훮nis about the road to his first electric car.
